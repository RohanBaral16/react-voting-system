# React E-Voting System - Concise Summary

## Features Implemented
This React-based e-voting frontend delivers a comprehensive digital voting platform featuring user authentication with multi-step registration, a personalized voter dashboard, and support for dual voting systems (FPTP & PR). Key features include a demo voting booth, live election results with interactive charts, candidate information pages, and real-time vote status tracking. The application implements protected and public routes for secure access control.

## Technologies Used
Built with React 19.2.0 and TypeScript, the project leverages Vite as the build tool and React Router DOM for navigation. State management is handled through React Context API, while React Hook Form manages form validation. Axios handles API communication with the Django backend. The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS 4.1.18 with Recharts for data visualization. Development tools include ESLint for code quality and Docker for containerization, with SWC compiler for optimized builds.

## Skills & Technologies Learnt
The project provided hands-on experience with advanced React patterns including Context API for global state, custom hooks, and protected route implementation. Key learnings include TypeScript integration for type safety, multi-step form implementation with progressive validation, modern build tooling with Vite and SWC, API integration with CSRF protection, data visualization with Recharts, responsive design using Tailwind CSS, session-based authentication flows, and Docker containerization with multi-stage builds.

## Remarks on Project Structure
The codebase follows a feature-first architecture with domain-organized modules (/features, /components/ui, /api, /context, /layout), promoting scalability and maintainability. The project demonstrates professional React development practices emphasizing code reusability, type safety, and excellent user experience.
